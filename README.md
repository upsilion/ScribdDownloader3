# ScribdDownloader3
A more flexible/robust script to get blurred/premium content on Scribd without paying!

### About
Scribd is a freemium content hosting platform that provides many useful documents. However, after the first few page of unblocked content, the rest is all blurred out with a payment request!! YUCK! 

However, the site intrestingly also downloads all the content locally making it very easy to just get the content anyways.

This application, ScribdDownloader3 is for all possible articles on scirbd.

### Usage

Run the file "ScribdDownloader3.py" and follow on screen instructions.

Output will be a link. The link has a perfect unblurred PDF of the content. To download it, there is a button in the top where you may download it through a PDF printer e.g cutePDF. Unfortunately, they use some weird flash layer to display it and not HTML thus cannot hijack the data automatically.

### ScribdDownloader2 vs ScribdDownloader3 ??

NOTES: 3 IS NOT INHERENTLY BETTER THAN 2!

3 is more flexible than 2, in that it works for all file types ie pdf and pictures however 2 is more automated! 3 is also avaliable on my repo
